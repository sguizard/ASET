column	description
contig	chromosome
position	position
variantID	variant ID
refAllele	reference allele
altAllele	alternative allele
refCount	reference allele read counts (from ASEReadCounter)
altCount	alternative allele read counts (from ASEReadCounter)
totalCount	ref + alt allele read counts (from ASEReadCounter)
lowMAPQDepth	counts of reads failing the MAPQ cutoff (from ASEReadCounter)
lowBaseQDepth	counts of reads failing the BaseQ cutoff (from ASEReadCounter)
rawDepth	raw read counts (from ASEReadCounter)
otherBases	read counts for alleles different from either ref or alt (from ASEReadCounter)
improperPairs	improperly paired read pairs (from ASEReadCounter)
strand	strand (based on the strandedness parameter)
RNAid	RNA sample ID ("sample" in the sample sheet)
hiCount	higher read counts of the alleles
loCount	lower read counts of the alleles
rawASE	|0.5 - refCount/totalCount|
rawASE_pvalue	biomial test p-value against 50% probability
nonAltFreq_perRNAid	non-alternative allele frequency at 1/1 sites, averaged per RNA sample

genes	gene IDs:symbols (including both exonic and intronic overlaps), ";" delimited when there are multiple
genes_exonic	gene IDs:symbols (only exonic),  ";" delimited when there are multiple
exons_merged	merged exon information, ";" delimited when there are multiple (exons for each gene are merged into a union set)
